##Compilation##
* For linux x64 Users, a binary is already available, the "main". Else, you can rebuild it easily (on Linux 32/64) by running ./build.sh (you might have to chmod +x build.sh to make it runnable).
* For Windows Users, you can use the command line available in the build.sh, as long as you have gcc installed.

##Execution##
./main(.exe on windows) SEED *(by default equals time(NULL)*
